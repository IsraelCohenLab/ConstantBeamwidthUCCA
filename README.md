# Constant Beamwidth UCCA

This folder contains the code for the following paper: 
Constant-Beamwidth Beamforming with Concentric Ring Arrays
Link to paper: https://israelcohen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/sensors-21-07253.pdf

Activating 'main.m' creates some of the paper's figures.
In addition, 'main.m' includes a time-domain implementation of the ideal filters.
If one desires to calculate and save these filters the flag 'should_save_filters' should be enabled.

Activating "extract_figures.m" gives more figures, and requires the files in 'saved_results' folder.
